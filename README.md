# Tutorial App via Expo

This app was created following the tutorial on the [Expo website](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial) in September 2024.

## How to setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. [Download the assets](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/#download-assets) from the expo website. After downloading the archive, unzip it and replace the existing assets directory with it in the project directory. These weren't committed to try and reduce repo size.
